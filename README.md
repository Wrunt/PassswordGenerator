PassswordGenerator
==================

Password Generator I'm working on for fun.

To use: 
unpack .zip to desired location
run PasswordGenerator.jar file
enter desired password length (preferred between 8 and 20 characters - default length = 12 characters)
click "Generate!" button
copy password to safe location (password will not be saved) as to company and/or personal guidelines

v1.2: bugfix
v1.1: Streamlined code (cut down on half of code)
v1: Initial Release

Planned features: Must Have checkboxes (for places that require at least one number, uppercase letter, lowercase letter, and/or symbol)
